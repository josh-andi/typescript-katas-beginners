# Typescript katas for beginners

These katas are aimed for people who haven't used TypeScript (TS) before.


## Description

All the katas are stored in the `src` directory.

For each task you will need to change the code in `solution.ts` to meet the test scenarios.
The tests are found in `solution.spec.ts` if you wish to see how they work but please don't modify them.

## Installation

`git clone https://github.com/josh-andi/typescript-katas-beginners.git`

## Scripts

- `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- `npm test` to run all the tests

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to create new katas and open up a new PR.
Some contributions may get rejected if we feel like they are too difficult for beginners.


### What makes a good kata?

- It should be small and self-contained (no external libraries required / moving parts)
- It should have a clear learning objective
- You should feel like you learnt something at the end of it
- make it fun!!!
- People should know how to run your kata
- Tests should focus on functionality and not non-functional requirements e.g. memory size / speed of execution. After all this is for beginners
- Tasks contain a description of what is expected (giving examples is great!)
- If your kata requires many instructions/hints then it might be too difficult or not clear enough
- It shouldn't rely on knowing a particular domain or subject to succeed (e.g. expecting people to know how castling works in chess)
  - If a kata does require domain knowledge, then the kata should clearly explain the rules so everyone is on a level playing field.
